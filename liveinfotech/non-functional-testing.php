                            <p>Lack of software performance can cause investment in additional resources, loss in the income, compromised customer experience, reduced competitiveness, and failure of project. Relating to the non-functional prerequisites of a system, our QAs check for its readiness. Our purpose is to solely monitor efficiency, usability, portability, and maintainability of the system being developed.
